# Bumper Monkeys
This game was completed during grade 11 in computer science.
I developed this game with 3 other people.
This game uses everything we had learned in class along with other
functions and concepts. Since we decided to use the Phaser game engine,
we had to relearn a bit of it because it wasn't taught in class.
